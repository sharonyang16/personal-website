# Personal Website

This site is meant to serve as a centeralized place to find my programming and design work along with information about me. Currently, the site is a work in progress and I'm planning on having the first release late March of 2024.

## Tech Stack

This site was created using

- Gatsby (React)
- JavaScript
- Material UI

The site currently has no backend, but that might change in the future as I add more and more work onto the site and it would become too difficult to manage without a proper backend.

## Design

The general layout for this site was designed using Figma. I will release a link to that Design File soon here.
